## Possible KPIs

1. Total Revenue: (Sum of unit_price * transaction_qty).

2. Product Churn: Identifying products with zero sales over a specific period (7+ days).

3. Footfall/Traffic: Number of transactions per hour. (Hourly Transaction Velocity (HTV): Average number of transactions processed per hour.)

4. Unit Concentration: Which product category (Coffee vs. Tea vs. Bakery) contributes most to the volume?

5. Location Index: A comparison score of how Store A performs against Store B in terms of total volume.


## Possible Business QUestions:

- Operational Efficiency: "What are the peak transaction hours by location (Store ID) to optimize staffing schedules?"

- Category Contribution: Which product_category generates the most revenue vs. the most volume?

- Seasonality & Trends: "How do sales patterns shift month-over-month? Is the 'Lower Manhattan' store more sensitive to weekend drops than 'Hell's Kitchen'?"

- Inventory Management: "Using the product_detail, which specific bean types or tea flavors are 'dead stock' (selling less than X units a month)?"

- Price Elasticity/Range: Within the "Coffee" category, do customers gravitate towards the $2.00 "Drip Coffee" or the $4.50 "Gourmet" options? Does this preference change based on the location

- Footfall Trends: Are there specific days of the week where certain stores underperform compared to their monthly average?



## Possible Problems the Client Wants Solved:  


- Waste: "We throw away too many pastries at the Lower Manhattan store."

- Efficiency: "Hell's Kitchen has long lines at 9 AM; we are losing customers who can't wait."

- Growth: "How do we get the average customer to spend $10 instead of $6?" (this is where the bundling idea comes in - tea & bakery)
